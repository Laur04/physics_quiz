    <p>
        This survey is a tool to use with the STEP UP Careers in Physics Lesson.  It will ask you to think about your goals, interests, and what is important to you
         for a career.  After taking this survey, this tool will find profiles of people with physics degrees and their jobs that you might not have considered for yourself.
    </p>
    <p>After taking the survey, you can view all of the career profiles by clicking on the â€œProfiles" link at the top of the page.</p>
    <p>If your teacher has asked you to, login into the classroom with the credentials they gave you to create your own physics profile.</p>
